We’re proud to support the SheTO community and the connections and  conversations it drives

Real talk, shared stories, and a little bit of magic. ✨
That’s what made this SheTO dinner so special — and why we’re proud to be part of this community.

At Moveworks, we believe the most meaningful progress happens when leaders come together with openness, honesty, and curiosity. Thank you to SheTO and everyone who joined for the conversation.

Pavithra Babu and her team at Siemens are on a mission that would have sounded like science fiction a few years ago: centralize IT support for 250K+ employees in 190+ countries.

There’s many complexities: legacy systems, languages, regional laws and solutions, duplication, you name it. 

Despite the challenge, they are seeing massive success with their Moveworks AI Assistant.
