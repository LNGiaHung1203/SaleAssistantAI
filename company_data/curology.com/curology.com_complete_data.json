        "text": "What’s something moms really want for Mother’s Day? To feel valued, supported, and set up to thrive at work.\n\nWe believe support for parents should be a part of everyday culture, not just reserved for a single holiday. Today and every day, we recognize the moms, mother figures, and caregivers who lead both at home and at work. At Curology, we’ve built an environment where they feel seen, supported, and empowered to thrive for the long term.\n\nHere’s how we support working parents and caregivers at Curology:\n• Paid leave for all new parents\n• A thriving Powerful Parents ERG for connection and community\n• Leaders who show up for their families and empower their teams to do the same\n• Thoughtful return-to-work support after leave\n• Flexibility that helps families prioritize what matters most\n• Access to benefits that support growing families and mental well-being\n\nBecause when we support mothers, mother figures, and caregivers, we do more than create a better workplace. We show up stronger for our patients with empathy, purpose, and care.\n\nAnd while support matters most, showing up empty-handed on Mother’s Day is never a great idea. Agency by Curology is always a good move! Right now, mom can get her first month of prescription anti-aging skincare free (just cover shipping and handling). Check it out here for full details on the offer: https://withagency.com/\n\nHappy Mother’s Day from all of us at Curology 💐\n\n#MothersDay #WorkingParents #CurologyCulture",
