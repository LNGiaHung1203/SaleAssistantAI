🌟 June is SANDS Awareness Month! 🌟

At NorthCare, we recognize the importance of raising awareness about stillbirth and neonatal death. Every year, countless families face the unimaginable pain of losing a child, and it’s crucial to support them through their grief.

This month, we encourage everyone to join us in spreading awareness, sharing stories, and providing support to those affected. Together, we can foster understanding and compassion in our communities.

💙 Here are a few ways you can get involved:

Share Your Story: If you or someone you know has experienced loss, sharing your story can help others feel less alone.
Educate Yourself and Others: Learn about the causes of stillbirth and neonatal death, and share this knowledge with your friends and family.
Support Local Organizations: Consider donating to or volunteering with organizations that provide support to grieving families.
Let’s come together to honor the memories of those lost and support families in their healing journey. 💖

June is PRIDE MONTH! #PrideMonth #LGBTQSupport #LGBTQAwareness #CelebrateDiversity. I don't know about you, but I think we could all use a little more kindness in our lives. 
“A long time ago I asked myself, ‘Do I want to be right, or do I want to be kind?’. I opted for kind.” ―   Jane Lynch
