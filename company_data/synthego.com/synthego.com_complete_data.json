This day is not only about raising awareness, it’s about recognizing how far we’ve come in the fight to treat and potentially cure this devastating genetic condition.\n\nIncredibly, scientific progress has been made through CRISPR-based therapies. In late 2023, the FDA approved Casgevy (exa-cel), the first CRISPR gene-editing therapy for curing sickle cell disease. This milestone marks a turning point, not just in how we treat SCD, but in how we think about the future of medicine.\n\nLearn more about sickle cell disease and how CRISPR is driving the next era of treatment.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gYPnzvz",

        "text": "Andrea E. took the stage as a panelist at the 25th American Pharma and Biotech Project, Program, and Portfolio Management Conference, where she shared her insights on leading biotech projects in today’s fast-moving landscape.\n\nHer key takeaway from the discussion:\n“Choosing the right approach in Biotech Projects is not a ‘One size fits all.’ Bringing new products to market demands agility and flexibility, but also discipline. Success lies in adaptive project management, supporting cross-functional project teams and stakeholders, and setting realistic expectations, all while maintaining the rigor of regulatory compliance and guidelines.”\n\nA powerful message for anyone navigating the challenges of innovation and execution.\n\nCongratulations to Andrea for not only contributing her expertise on stage, but also inspiring the next generation of project, program, and portfolio leaders driving progress in pharma and biotech. \n\nThank you Andrea for being a leader and rockstar here at Synthego! We appreciate all that you do! 💚",

As a scientist, I get to share my perspective on oligonucleotide chemistry and how we approach making high-quality genome editing tools. Workshops like this are key to establishing standards and driving meaningful benchmark comparisons across the field. I’m especially looking forward to the scientific conversations and tech talks this week!” - Puzhou Wang\n\n🧬 As CRISPR-based therapies move rapidly toward the clinic, standardization and benchmarking aren't just helpful - they're essential. We're working with NIST and Consortium partners to lay the foundation for safe, effective, and scalable CRISPR therapeutics.\n\n💡 Want to join the conversation?\n The public session on June 12 is FREE and open to all - a unique chance to hear where the field is heading and how collaborative science is shaping the future of medicine.\n\n👉 Register here: https://lnkd.in/dxJy_gE9",
