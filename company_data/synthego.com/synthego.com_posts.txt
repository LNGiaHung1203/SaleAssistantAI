Today, we honor the strength and resilience of the millions living with sickle cell disease (SCD) around the world. This day is not only about raising awareness, it’s about recognizing how far we’ve come in the fight to treat and potentially cure this devastating genetic condition.

Incredibly, scientific progress has been made through CRISPR-based therapies. In late 2023, the FDA approved Casgevy (exa-cel), the first CRISPR gene-editing therapy for curing sickle cell disease. This milestone marks a turning point, not just in how we treat SCD, but in how we think about the future of medicine.

Learn more about sickle cell disease and how CRISPR is driving the next era of treatment.

Andrea E. took the stage as a panelist at the 25th American Pharma and Biotech Project, Program, and Portfolio Management Conference, where she shared her insights on leading biotech projects in today’s fast-moving landscape.

Her key takeaway from the discussion:
“Choosing the right approach in Biotech Projects is not a ‘One size fits all.’ Bringing new products to market demands agility and flexibility, but also discipline. Success lies in adaptive project management, supporting cross-functional project teams and stakeholders, and setting realistic expectations, all while maintaining the rigor of regulatory compliance and guidelines.”

A powerful message for anyone navigating the challenges of innovation and execution.

Congratulations to Andrea for not only contributing her expertise on stage, but also inspiring the next generation of project, program, and portfolio leaders driving progress in pharma and biotech. 

Thank you Andrea for being a leader and rockstar here at Synthego! We appreciate all that you do! 💚

Synthego Prevails In Patent Appeal Confirming Agilent CRISPR Patents Are Invalid

The U.S. Court of Appeals has upheld the PTAB’s decision in favor of Synthego, confirming that Agilent’s CRISPR gRNA modification patents remain invalidated.  

We see this ruling benefitting the entire CRISPR market, researchers, therapeutic developers and solution providers, by affirming continued access to the chemical modifications that clients rely on to develop world-class therapeutics.

🔬 Synthego at the NIST Genome Editing Consortium Workshop - June 12th
 CRISPR is transforming the future of medicine - and we’re proud to help shape the standards that will drive it forward.

This week, Puzhou Wang, Director of R&D at Synthego, is representing us in the closed NIST Consortium member session, contributing insights on oligonucleotide chemistry and how our technology powers high-quality, safer therapeutic CRISPR solutions.

“I’m excited to be attending the NIST Genome Editing Consortium workshop on behalf of Synthego. As a scientist, I get to share my perspective on oligonucleotide chemistry and how we approach making high-quality genome editing tools. Workshops like this are key to establishing standards and driving meaningful benchmark comparisons across the field. I’m especially looking forward to the scientific conversations and tech talks this week!” - Puzhou Wang

🧬 As CRISPR-based therapies move rapidly toward the clinic, standardization and benchmarking aren't just helpful - they're essential. We're working with NIST and Consortium partners to lay the foundation for safe, effective, and scalable CRISPR therapeutics.

💡 Want to join the conversation?
 The public session on June 12 is FREE and open to all - a unique chance to hear where the field is heading and how collaborative science is shaping the future of medicine.

At Synthego, we’re all about making an impact, and Emily Watkins, our Principal Talent Partner, does just that EVERY DAY! 🚀

One of Emily’s favorite parts of her role? Watching new team members grow, connect, and truly shine ✨. She loves seeing individuals she’s hired not only thrive but even step into leadership roles as hiring managers she gets to partner with in a whole new way. Full-circle moments like these are what make her work so meaningful 💼💙.

But Emily’s talents don’t stop at talent acquisition! Outside of work, she unleashes her creativity 🎭. With a background in Theater (yes, she majored in it!), Emily loves exploring artistic outlets and finding new ways to spark her imagination.

Emily Watkins, your blend of passion, creativity, and dedication inspires us and reminds us just how special our team is! 🙌
