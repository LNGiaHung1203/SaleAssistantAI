Some of our favorite pet-inspired graphic tees are now available through Chewy's platform.\n\nOur Fort Point neighbors (literally - they've got an office a block away from our Arthouse here in Boston), Chewy has been THE innovator and leader in the pet space for a dog's age. We couldn't be more thrilled to get this collab off the ground, and we have so much more to show you!\n\nSo keep a floppy ear to the ground for more updates... and give your sweet, fuzzy friends at home a pet for us, will you?",
